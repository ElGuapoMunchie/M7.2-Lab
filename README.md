# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project was an excercise in creating a website layout given several images, and base html code. Only the css needed to be edited in order to make the changes, which include implementing a menu bar that sticks to the top of the page when you scroll past it, a two-column layout for the article and images section, and a grid where the images are displayed.

## Compiling and Viewing the Webpage

First, clone this repository into a new directory on your local machine. Then, you may view the webpage by opening the directory in `VSCode` and display it either by using the `LivePreview` extension, or by debugging the website.

Alternatively, you can launch the website by calling `open index.html` in your terminal application after navigating to the directory where the files are stored.
